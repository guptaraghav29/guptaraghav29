## 👋 Hi, I’m Raghav Gupta (@guptaraghav29)

I’m an **aspiring Product Manager** with a strong technical foundation, learning to become an **AI-native builder** — someone who understands users, designs products, *and* can prototype and ship with modern AI tools.

I’m especially interested in products at the intersection of **software, data, and machine learning**, and I enjoy thinking about *why* we build things just as much as *how* we build them.

### 🧠 What I’m focused on right now

* Developing **product thinking**: user problems, tradeoffs, metrics, and iteration
* Building hands-on projects using **AI/ML and full-stack tools**
* Learning how AI changes product discovery, UX, and decision-making

### 🛠️ How I like to build

* Start from a **real user problem**
* Prototype quickly, test assumptions, and iterate
* Use code and data as tools to explore ideas — not just implementation details

### 🤝 Open to collaborating on

* Early-stage product ideas or MVPs
* AI-powered applications and experiments
* Projects where product, engineering, and learning overlap

### 📫 Let’s connect
